    You said that you love me, but you told a lie
    Outside you're lovely, but I've seen inside
    And all of your friends told me
    Time wasn't right
    You go too slow, you stay so cold
    I speak my mind, you still say no
    It's blurry nights that haunt my mind
    Don't wanna find out, might just cry
    I might have tied myself up high
    And just let go, I'll touch the sky for you
    It's blurry nights I can't get through
    You told me lies I thought were true
    But I'll get over you
    Two things on my birthday
    I don't want a cake give me a sundae
    Where I don't think of getting hanged
    I don't wanna play just give one day
    Where I don't think of getting played
    I'm a sensitive guy with no touch√©
    I done fucked up, on my plate
    I got plenty of problems, It's too late
    It's blurry nights that haunt my mind
    Don't wanna find out, might just cry
    I might have tied myself up high
    And just let go, I'll touch the sky for you
    It's blurry nights I can't get through
    You told me lies I thought were true
    But I'll get over you
    You go too slow, you stay so cold
    I speak my mind, you still say no
    It's blurry nights that haunt my mind
    Don't wanna find out, might just cry
    I might have tied myself up high
    And just let go, I'll touch the sky for you
    It's blurry nights I can't get through
    You told me lies I thought were true
    But I'll get over you
